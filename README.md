#Dog's Best Friend (Backend)

Rails API backend for Dog's Best Friend. Adopting or fostering a dog is a substantial commitment, and not one everybody can afford. But NYC shelter dogs still need our help! Dog's Best Friend lets the user browse real NYC shelter dogs and donate to their cause. This app was built with React/Redux and a Rails API backend. Payments are powered through Stripe in a test environment, please do not use any real payment info. The app is currently deployed through Heroku at https://dogsbestfriend.herokuapp.com/
